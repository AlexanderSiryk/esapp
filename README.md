This project was developed as coursework on the subject of Numerical Methods. In a nutshell, this is an online password manager which encrypts user's accounts on the client-side, and stores them in the SQL database on the PHP server. <br/>
Course work assignment - development of the image-key, based on hash-key, created by pbkdf2 function. The image-key has the same properties as a hash-key (encrypt and decrypt AES blocks), but it is much easier to store and use. I developed the SPA using ReactJS and ReduxJS. <br/>
####The applications consist of 3 modules: <br/>
1. Sign in with the Google Oauth 2.0 protocol. 
2. The decryption of the user's data which came from the server. 
3. The representation of the decrypted user's data.
